# SEA_LEVEL_PF
## Database schema for SEA LEVEL data collected from TIDE STATIONS in South Pacific Ocean from 2009-06-13 to 2021-01-28

This postgresql code is relative to the database titled "SEA LEVEL collected from TIDE STATIONS in South Pacific Ocean from 2009-06-13 to 2021-01-28", hosted by the National Oceanic and Oceanographic (NOAA), National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) under Reference ID: GA4G86 (original submission on October 12, 2021).

The Database was created under the PostgreSQL database management.

## Schema
The database schema consists of a single table. Each row of the table is a measure of the height of a tide. 
Regarding this table schema, we can make the following comments:
-	ID is an automatically generated integer that is incremented when rows are inserted into the database. It is just an identifier with no semantics.  We declared ID as the primary key of the table.
-	STATION identifies the station from which the measurement was made. 
-	SENSOR identifies the sensor which was used for the measurement. Possible sensor values are RADAR, PRESSURE and FLOAT. Only RADAR values are currently listed in the database.
-	RAW_TIME_UTC is the timestamp of the measurement accurate to the minute.
-	FLAG1 defines the origin of the measurement (IOC timestamp or tide-gauge GPS timestamp)
-	RAW_DATA is the raw measurement value
-	FLAG2 is either equal to VALID, INVALID (there was a problem with the measurement) or MISSING (in this case RAW_DATA is equal to NULL)
-	CORRECT_TIME_UTC is the timestamp of the measurement accurate to the minute after correction
-	FLAG3 is equal to ADJUSTED when the raw timestamp was corrected (this can happen with IOC timestamps only). Otherwise, it is equal to the FLAG1 value. 
-	CORR_DATA is the measurement value after correction
-	FLAG4 is either equal to VALID (in this case CORR_DATA is equal to RAW_DATA), CORR_APPL (a correction was applied) or MISSING (in this case CORR_DATA is equal to NULL)

We also declared 5 domain constraints enumerating the possible values for attributes SENSOR, FLAG1, FLAG2, FLAG3 and FLAG4.

Finally, we declared the constituent {STATION, SENSOR, FLAG1, CORRECT_TIME_UTC} as a candidate key of the table meaning that for a given station, a given sensor and a given data origin, CORRECT_TIME_UTC is unique.

## Functions about Julian Time
### JulianTime(t)
We found out useful to write a function computing the Julian time corresponding to a given timestamp (whether it is a RAW_TIME_UTC timestamp or a CORRECT_TIME_UTC timestamp). 
We wrote function JulianTime(t) in PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL). JulianTime(t) extends the native postgreSQL function `to_char(t,'J')` which computes the Julian day from timestamp t. JulianTime(t) is a stored function meaning it is compiled and stored in the database. It can be used in any SQL query:

`SELECT julianTime(RAW_TIME_UTC) FROM MEASURES WHERE ID=2;`

### Min1900(t)
We also wrote a function expressing the Julian time in terms of minutes only.  
This function can also be invoked in any SQL query:

`SELECT Min1900(RAW_TIME_UTC) FROM MEASURES WHERE ID=2;`

**Nota Bene**: the reference time for the computation of Julian time (in days) is January 1, 1900 noon UTC, with a Julian time value of 2415021.0
